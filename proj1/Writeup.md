# Writeup

For our first project, we were tasked with evaluating and grading five different repositories using a provided rubric to determine their quality. Additionally, we had to choose one of these projects and attempt to run it. One of the main difficulties we encountered was that all of these projects were between two to three years old and had not been actively maintained. This presented a challenge because many of the dependencies required to run these projects had become outdated, making it a demanding task to get them functioning properly. <br>

During our exploration of the provided projects, we encountered a significant challenge: the absence of adequate documentation. For instance, the documentation for the Job Application System was notably unengaging and lacked essential information in the readme. Moreover, the installation guide was incomplete, requiring us to rely on prior knowledge of React to fill in the missing steps.
Similarly, the Lecture Flash Card Generator lacked proper documentation regarding the installation process and dependency instructions. While reviewing the documentation for the Application Tracking System, we found that the provided instructions for running the program were insufficient for new users. It appeared that some crucial steps for execution were missing.
The E-Commerce Cheapest Deal Finder project presented another challenge, as there were no clear instructions provided on how to run the program and install it. Additionally, there was no accompanying video tutorial to facilitate a better understanding of the project.
Finally, the video tutorial for the Movie Recommendation System was problematic, as it contained excessive technical jargon and was difficult to comprehend.<br>

During the installation process, we encountered several difficulties primarily arising from outdated dependencies, given that these projects are old. In the case of the Job Application System, we noted that the Requirements.txt file did not include all the necessary dependencies, and those listed were outdated. Furthermore, issues arose due to the absence of the required database or any clear documentation regarding its structure.
Similarly, when attempting to set up the Lecture Flash Card Generator, we faced challenges as the setup.py file did not function as expected. Troubleshooting steps within the repository were notably absent, compounding our installation difficulties.
For the Application Tracking System, we encountered problems related to the setup.sh script, and we couldn't locate any troubleshooting guidance within the project's repository.
Additionally, we discovered that the Streamlit website associated with the E-Commerce Cheapest Deal Finder project was non-functional. This made it even more challenging for us to understand the project's code, and the situation was exacerbated by the inadequate presence of comments in the codebase.<br>

We're taking steps to enhance our project in several ways. First, we're broadening its scope by introducing additional features. Our current repository lacks clarity and detail, so we're making it more comprehensive and user-friendly. This will help prevent the issues we encountered during our own implementation.
In terms of documentation, we're making it more engaging by incorporating GIFs and images to grab users' attention and keep them interested. Furthermore, we're addressing the absence of future development prospects in the readme file, making it easier for others to contribute and enhance our open-source software.
To make our project more accessible, we're simplifying technical jargon in the documentation and providing clear, step-by-step installation instructions. These improvements will ensure that our project is more user-friendly, attractive, and open to collaboration.<br>

Conclusion and Learnings from Project:<br><br>
Our project evaluation highlighted crucial lessons:<br>

1. Documentation Matters: Incomplete or unclear documentation hinders project evaluation and future work. Comprehensive documentation is essential for present and future team members.

2. Up-to-Date Dependencies: Keeping dependencies current is vital to avoid issues during setup and execution.

3. User-Friendly Focus: Enhancing the project's clarity and simplifying technical language makes it more accessible.

4. Engaging Documentation: Including visuals like GIFs and images in documentation maintains user interest.

5. Future Planning: Addressing future development prospects in the readme encourages open-source contributions and ensures project sustainability.
